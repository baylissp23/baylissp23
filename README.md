### About Me
Hi! My name is Paul, and I am a BSc Computer Science student studying at the University of Southampton. I am currently in my first year, and love learning new things about the field. Programming in Python is one of my strengths, and I am currently learning C. I have interests in the worlds of cyber security, cloud computing and web development. I intend to use the rest of my first year at university to further my knowledge in these fields, and work on projects that are related.

Stuff here coming soon. Keep an eye out!
